# Bedwars Reloaded

## Description

I'm coding this plugin **for fun**. I decided to renew my Java skills. I love coding and I love gaming. So whats the best way to renew programming skills? Of course: Develope something in a game.
A good friend of mine playing a lot of minecraft and he's telling me a lot about it. After he mentioned the minecraft plugin "Bedwars" I was interested in, too. After playing it the first time I decided to reprogram that plugin and started with the developing of **Bedwars Reloaded**.
